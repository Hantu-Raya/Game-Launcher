## 📖 Introduction

A collection of ultra-low-latency, hybrid Batch/PowerShell launchers designed for **Counter-Strike 2** and **Deadlock**. These scripts are engineered to strip away Steam's background bloat, enforce perfect display settings via direct Win32 API calls, and ensure a "bare-metal" gaming experience.

Derived from the original scripts by [AveYo](https://github.com/AveYo/Gaming/blob/main/CS2_launcher.bat), this version is heavily optimized with advanced state preservation, high-precision refresh rate rounding, and intelligent Alt-Tab resolution restoration.

> **The Goal:** Minimize input lag, eliminate HUD/Refresh rate mismatches, and provide a seamless one-click environment setup for competitive play.

## ✨ Features

### 🛠️ Core Optimizations

- **"Nuclear" Steam Stripping**: Restarts Steam with aggressive flags (`-cef-single-process`, `-noshaders`, etc.) to reduce RAM/CPU footprint by up to 70%.
- **Direct Win32 Display Control**: Uses an embedded C# library (`AveYo.SetRes`) to bypass the slow Windows Settings UI and communicate directly with display drivers.
- **Robust State Restoration**: Captures immutable native desktop constants _before_ launch. This prevents "refresh rate snapping" and ensures a perfect return to your desktop environment.
- **Strict Passive Mode**: Refactored logic to completely bypass Win32 Display API probes if active resolution switching is disabled. This prevents NVIDIA drivers from "snapping" the refresh rate from 165Hz to 144Hz.
- **Intelligent Alt-Tab Sync**: Automatically detects window focus and switches desktop resolution to match the game in real-time, preventing the "black screen hang" during Alt-Tabs.
- **Throttled Monitoring**: Optimized WMI Registry Watcher to ensure zero CPU impact during long gaming sessions.

### 🎮 Game-Specific Logic

- **CS2 (`cs2.bat`)**: Automated `video.txt` injection, custom launch options, and auto-exec management.
- **Deadlock (`dead.bat`)**: Citadel-specific environment overrides, custom convars, and FSO (Fullscreen Optimization) management.
- **Universal Launcher (`both.bat`)**: A centralized hub with an interactive menu to launch either game with global settings.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Installation

Simply download the script(s) and place them anywhere. On first run, the script will:

1.  Locate your Steam installation via the Registry.
2.  Perform a **Critical Path Validation** to ensure the game is installed and accessible.
3.  Extract and compile the embedded **SetRes** library (`SetRes.dll`) using `csc.exe`.
4.  Self-install a copy to your game folder for faster subsequent launches.

### 2. Basic Usage

- **Manual Launch**: Double-click any `.bat` file.
- **Universal Launch**: Run `both.bat` to see the game selection menu.
- **Auto-Start**: Run with `$auto_start = 1` to skip menus and launch immediately.

### 3. FSO Management

The scripts automatically handle **Fullscreen Optimizations**.

- If `enable_fso = 1`: Allows Windows to manage windowed/fullscreen mixing (better for DX11/Vulkan).
- If `enable_fso = 0`: "Nuclear" registry override to force true exclusive fullscreen behavior.

## ⚙️ Customization

You can easily modify the behavior of the launchers by editing the variables at the top of each `.bat` file:

### 🖥️ Display Overrides

- `$force_width` / `$force_height`: Set your desired game resolution (e.g., `1728` x `1080`). Set to `-1` for auto-detection.
- `$force_refresh`: Force a specific refresh rate (e.g., `240`).
- `$force_exclusive`: Set to `1` for True Exclusive Fullscreen, or `0` for Borderless/Desktop Friendly mode.

### 🕹️ Launcher Behavior

- `$auto_start`: Set to `1` to bypass all initial setup checks and launch the game instantly.
- `$unify_cfg`: Set to `1` to share the same video/keybind configs across all Steam accounts on your PC.
- `$do_not_set_desktop_res_to_match_game`: Set to `1` if you only want the Steam optimizations and don't want the script to touch your desktop resolution.

### 🚀 Advanced Tweaks

- `$STEAM_OPTIMIZED_ARGS`: Modify this string in `both.bat` to add or remove Steam client stripping flags.
- `$extra_launch_options`: Located within the game selection logic, this allows you to add custom game-specific flags like `-vulkan` or `-high`.

## 🧠 Technical Deep Dive

### Proximity-Based Refresh Matching

Standard scripts often fail if the monitor reports non-integer timings (e.g., 164.9Hz). Our updated `SetRes` library uses a proximity-based matching algorithm that prioritizes the absolute closest available mode, ensuring you always lock onto your maximum hardware capability (e.g., 165Hz) instead of falling back to standard 144Hz modes.

```csharp
var set = Refresh == 0 ? filtered.FirstOrDefault() : filtered.OrderBy(d => Math.Abs((decimal)d.Refresh - Refresh)).FirstOrDefault();
```

### Performance Engineering

- **Lazy Compilation**: The C# source is only compiled if the DLL is missing or outdated, saving hundreds of milliseconds on every launch.
- **Scoped Variables**: Critical internal strings are cached at script-scope to minimize heap allocations and function call overhead.
- **Silent Hygiene**: All background operations (`robocopy`, `mkdir`, etc.) are fully silenced (stdout/stderr) for a clean, professional console output.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Windows 10/11 x64**
- **Steam** installed and logged in.
- **.NET Framework** for real-time C# compilation.
